# RESTORA (working name Aharos) — Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-10-09 — end of the master program (Groups 1-9). Current, verified status is in
`docs/stabilization-report.md` §8 (evidence), `docs/master-feature-audit.md` (feature by feature, the source of
truth) and `docs/group-delivery-map.md` (where each group lives). The sections below "Earlier status" are the
historical record up to Phase 5B and are kept as written._

## Current status (2026-10-09)
Groups 1-9 of the master program are implemented on branch `claude/serene-ramanujan-rmvdss` (PR #1 into `main`).
Of the 187 audited rows: **{{VERIFIED}} IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED, {{NEV}} IMPLEMENTED + NOT EXTERNALLY VERIFIED (mock / emulator only),
{{PARTIAL}} PARTIAL, {{NOTBUILT}} NOT BUILT, 3 INTENTIONALLY DEFERRED** (multi-outlet / multi-restaurant). Nothing is claimed live
that has not run against its provider.

| Group | Contents | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Integrity | vendor approval gate, issue-to-department stock moves, idempotency and locking | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED |
| 2 Reorder | reorder engine, POs and indents from it | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED |
| 3 Kitchen production + money desk | production, wastage, worksheet, manual sales, variance, money desk, day lock | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED |
| 4 Menu engineering + costing | menu engineering, department P&L, daily costing, stock matrix, supplier prices, labels, overhead % | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED |
| 5 Integrations | Tally / Zoho sync, Sheets sync, aggregator finance, nightly POS re-pull, control room | IMPLEMENTED + NOT EXTERNALLY VERIFIED (emulators and mocks only) |
| 6 Growth / CRM | consent-gated messaging, e-mail (Resend), loyalty tiers, coupons, referrals, feedback loop, campaigns, lifecycle automations, 9 AM summary, guest offers | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED against the mock provider; real delivery NOT EXTERNALLY VERIFIED |
| 7 / 8 Floor, mobile, kitchen | held bills, move / merge / split bills, booking notes on tickets, "table ready" message, measured dish prep times, late alerts, upsell, universal search, owner approvals on the phone | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (native apps, offline captain, e-invoice IRN are NOT BUILT) |
| Purchasing, expiry, master data, staff ops | approval rules, line review, one queue, indent fulfilment, expiry list, CSV import, brand / vendor contacts, aggregator on / off, roster, checklists, hours, invitations | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED (aggregator on / off and invitation e-mail: NOT EXTERNALLY VERIFIED) |
| 9 Hardening | database-enforced append-only history, shared rate limits, observability, load, accessibility, responsive | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED; row-level security remains PARTIAL by design |
| QR-08, notifications | order again / split the bill from the phones; purchase-approval, reservation, low-stock and vendor-dues notifications | IMPLEMENTED + VERIFIED |

**Verified at the final commit** (details and dates: `docs/stabilization-report.md` §8): typecheck and lint clean on both Prisma clients;
Vitest {{SQLITE}} on SQLite and {{PG}} on PostgreSQL 16; both migration histories apply to an empty database with no drift; browser E2E
{{E2E}}; investor flow 3/3; desktop build, E2E, packaging and DMG on Windows and both macOS architectures in CI; backup / restore
drill 10/10 and an end-to-end load run with zero correctness violations on the current schema; axe (WCAG 2.1 A / AA) and ten-viewport
sweeps clean. The browser suites are CI release gates.

**Not verified (external):** hosting and HTTPS, scheduled backups / WAL archiving on real infrastructure, a hosted PostgreSQL instance,
code-signing certificates, and every real provider (Razorpay keys, Petpooja, Zomato / Swiggy, WhatsApp / SMS, Resend mailbox, Tally,
Zoho Books, Google Sheets, printers). PostgreSQL row-level security is designed but not applied (`docs/postgres-rls.md`).
Full list with what each needs: `docs/stabilization-report.md` §8.4.

Phase 14 verification (2026-10-05, 1.0.0-rc.1, before Groups 1-5): Vitest 887 passed on SQLite and 865 on PostgreSQL 16,
browser E2E 77/77 on both databases, desktop E2E 7/7, packaged-desktop security 23/23, no migration drift; DR drill 11/11, PITR 7/7,
staging deployment rehearsal smoke 18/18.

## 2026-10-06 — production completion pass (real menu, Razorpay, QR)
Report: `docs/production-completion-report.md`.
- **Real menu**: Coders' Cafe, 64 items / 8 categories transcribed from the owner's board photos, 10 unreadable entries listed and not imported (`docs/coders-cafe-menu.md`, `npm run db:seed:cafe [-- --reset]`, org-scoped reset).
- **Razorpay**: Checkout on the guest order page (CSP opened for Razorpay on `/o/*` only); undecided = PENDING (never failed); FAILED → SUCCESS recovery when Razorpay confirms a capture (retry in the same window, late capture); a capture for an order already paid another way → HIGH reconciliation anomaly, never applied twice; stored gateway reference is authoritative; production refuses an incomplete Razorpay config (`docs/payments-razorpay.md`). **Not yet run against Razorpay's real test mode: needs `rzp_test_` keys** (`scripts/razorpay/sandbox-check.ts`).
- **Table QR**: scannable QR (SVG, download) on the Tables screen, encoding `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`; QR ordering can be disabled per table (revoke).
- **Tests**: Razorpay emulator (`tests/support/razorpayEmulator.ts`); `tests/domain/coders-cafe-*.test.ts`; investor browser E2E `npm run e2e:investor` (owner / manager / chef / customer; Razorpay success, cash, decline + retry).

## 2026-10-06 — customer website (table QR storefront)
Doc: `docs/customer-web.md`. The guest QR pages (`/t/<token>`, `/o/<orderId>`) became the
customer website — Coders' Cafe branded, any other restaurant neutral — on the existing
guest-ordering services (no second order / payment / kitchen engine).
- **Pages**: home + menu (landing, categories, item sheet with real variants / add-ons, sticky cart),
  `/t/<token>/cart` (server-priced), `/t/<token>/checkout` (optional name / phone, Cash / Pay online),
  order page (confirmation, 5-step live tracker from the KOTs, Razorpay, bill), My orders, About / Contact
  (only facts entered in Admin → Outlets).
- **Server**: `POST /api/qr/t/<token>/quote` (read-only pricing, unavailable lines, own per-IP limit);
  placement checks every line before creating anything, opening hours, optional phone → CRM
  find-or-create (`Order.customerId`), payment choice in the staff notification; `guestTracker`.
- **Tests**: `tests/domain/guest-storefront.test.ts` (14), quote route test, rewritten `tests/ui/guest.test.tsx` (16),
  `e2e/storefront.spec.ts` (4: phones 390/393/430, price change + sold out in cart, two guests at one table,
  double tap / closed hours / disabled QR); QR and investor E2E moved to the cart → checkout flow.
- No schema change, no migration.

## Verification gate (historical: Phase 5B, 2026-10-02; superseded by the current status above)
| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| `prisma format` / `validate` / `generate` | ✅ |

All additive or data-preserving; no historical timestamps rewritten.

## Status by category

### ✅ COMPLETE (implemented, tested, exposed via API)
| Subsystem | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Auth, sessions, RBAC, org/outlet scope | Opaque hashed session tokens, expiry, revocation; deterministic dummy bcrypt hash equalizes unknown-user timing |
| Procurement (indent→PO→GRN→bill→payment, dues) | + read/list APIs for indents, POs, GRNs, bills, vendor payments |
| Inventory ledger, transfers, issues, stock counts | + read/list APIs (transfers visible at both ends) |
| Wastage documents, production batches | DRAFT→POSTED / DRAFT→IN_PROGRESS→COMPLETED, one-shot ledger posting |
| Master data | Units (+conversions), material categories, materials, vendors (+vendor-material links, bank masking), outlets (timezone), floors, tables (status, QR token rotation) — `/api/master` |
| Menu | Org menu + **per-outlet price / offered / sold-out overrides**; server-side pricing; modifier groups can be renamed / re-ruled / retired (`PATCH /api/menu/modifier-groups/:id`) |
| Recipes | Authoring, versions, effective dates, approval, cycle protection, costing; reads resolve material / sub-recipe / unit names (recipe.view is enough to read); list search; named cost lines; shared `RECIPE_VERSION_TRANSITIONS` |
| Orders / KOT / KDS | **Idempotency-Key on creation** (retry → original; conflicting reuse → 409); no double payment on settled orders; payments capped at outstanding |
| Payments / refunds | Server-side verification; partial refunds; gateway refunds executed via provider + **refund webhooks applied** (dedup on gateway refund id) |
| CRM, loyalty | Points only from PAID orders; DB-unique per order |
| Reservations / waitlist | **DB-level double-booking protection** (`ReservationSlot` locks) on SQLite and PostgreSQL |
| Staff | Role-rank authority, owner protection |
| Finance | Expenses, petty cash, cash drawer, reconciliation, daily closing, P&L — **outlet-timezone business days** |
| Reconciliation | PAYMENTS / POS / GATEWAY / AGGREGATOR / VENDOR, locked on completion, anomalies on exceptions |
| Webhooks | POS, payment (captured / failed / refund.processed / unknown→ignored), aggregator; retry-safe |
| Anomalies, notifications, analytics | Per-outlet timezone bucketing in SQL |
| Reports (14) + CSV | Registry, row caps, pagination; date-only filters = outlet business days |
| Export jobs | Inline CSV **and** background jobs on an in-process runner (not in the request): PENDING→RUNNING→SUCCESS/FAILED(→EXPIRED) via `EXPORT_TRANSITIONS`, run-time re-authorization, single execution, startup recovery, retention cleanup, full audit trail, opaque ids (`docs/exports.md`) |
| Security hardening | Rate limiting (login per email + IP, webhooks, reports, exports); Origin checks on all state-changing routes incl. login/logout; body caps; security headers + same-origin CSP (env-aware; `docs/exports.md`); serializable transactions with retry |

### 🟡 PARTIAL
| Item | What is missing |
|------|-----------------|
| Analytics day/hour bucketing in DST zones | One UTC offset per outlet per query; rows across a DST switch inside the range shift by 1h (finance business days are exact) |
| Rate limiting across instances | In-memory store only; multi-instance needs a shared store |
| Export storage across instances | Local filesystem only; multi-instance needs shared object storage |

### 🧪 MOCK (deterministic development adapters)
POS (`mock`), payment gateway (`mock`: verify, refund, settlement feed, webhooks), aggregators (`mock`/`zomato`/`swiggy` names → mock adapter), notifications (console), accounting export (generic CSV rows). Mock providers are **refused in production** unless `ALLOW_MOCK_PROVIDERS=true` — now enforced by the payment and POS factories too (previously only the webhook path; verification / refunds / reconciliation fell back to the mock, and unknown provider names silently became the mock).

### 🦴 SKELETON (interface wired, not functional)
`PetpoojaPOSProvider`, `RazorpayPaymentProvider` (verify/refund/settlements/webhook parsing throw "requires credentials"), `EmailNotificationProvider`, `TallyAccountingProvider` (same format as generic).

### 🔑 REQUIRES EXTERNAL CREDENTIALS / VERIFIED PROVIDER BEHAVIOUR
Petpooja, Razorpay, Zomato/Swiggy partner APIs, email/WhatsApp. **No real provider is integrated.**

### 🐘 POSTGRESQL
- ✅ Suite + browser E2E executed on PostgreSQL 16.14 (448/448, 49/49); baseline migration deployed and drift-checked.
- ✅ Fixed (found by executing): raw-SQL date bounds shifted by the server TimeZone; case-sensitive search; stale `prisma/postgres` artifacts.
- ❌ Row-Level Security: **design only** (`docs/postgres-rls.md`, now with the exact production requirement); no policies applied.
- ⚠️ Provider switch + committed PostgreSQL migration history (`/prisma/postgres/` is git-ignored), explicit `@db.Decimal` precision — deployment steps (docs/production-readiness.md M3).

### ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- Shared (Redis) rate-limit store; out-of-process export worker for multi-instance deployments (`ExportRunner` is the integration point; an in-process background runner and an inline runner exist).
- Nonce-based script CSP (removes `'unsafe-inline'`; needs nonce middleware on every route).
- Customer addresses service; department admin; aggregator admin API.

### 🔮 FUTURE (schema capabilities deliberately not added)
| Capability | Decision |
|-----------|----------|
| Per-user read state for broadcast notifications | Future: needs `NotificationRead(notificationId, userId)`. Personal notifications already have correct per-user state. |
| Shift rostering (assign people to shifts) | Future: needs `ShiftAssignment`. Attendance works without it. |
| Expense approval workflow | Future: needs `Expense.status` + approver. Expenses are recorded directly today. |
| (Per-outlet menu price/availability) | **Done this pass** (`OutletMenuItem`) — essential for multi-outlet operations. |

## E2E coverage
| Flow | Where |
|------|-------|
| Vendor→PO→GRN→ledger→bill→payment | `workflows`, `finance`, `master-data` |
| Recipe→menu→order→payment→consumption→food cost→margin | `recipes`, `flows` |
| **Customer→reservation→table→order→payment→loyalty (single chain)** | `tests/e2e/guest-journey.test.ts` |
| Wastage→ledger→cost→analytics/anomaly | `production-wastage` |
| POS webhook (+ duplicates) | `webhooks-reconciliation`, `flows` |
| Stock count freeze→variance→approval→adjustment | `workflows` |
| Wrong outlet / wrong org / unauthorized | every suite + `api/*` |

## Frontend (phase 1)
| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Architecture | ✅ | `src/lib` (API client, errors, polling, formatting, idempotency, nav), `src/components/{ui,layout}`, `src/features/{pos,kitchen}` (pure logic + components). Browser code only calls `/api/*`; server components use the session + services directly. |
| Login + protected routes | ✅ | `/login`; middleware redirect for `/dashboard`, `/pos`, `/kitchen`; pages re-validate the session server-side; open-redirect-safe `next` |
| Operator shell | ✅ | Sidebar (collapsible), outlet switcher (preference cookie, server-validated), user + roles, unread notifications count, sign-out, permission-aware nav |
| Dashboard | ✅ | Real data only, per permission: net sales today (outlet business day), open orders, kitchen tickets, today's reservations, open anomalies |
| POS (`/pos`) | ✅ | Real menu with per-outlet price/sold-out; categories, search (`/`), variants + modifier rules; dine-in (floor/table picker, running order, extra rounds) / takeaway / delivery; customer lookup/create; atomic idempotent placement (`POST /api/orders` with items); save / send to kitchen / pay / cancel / discount; counter payments (cash change, split, retry-confirm without double charge) |
| KDS (`/kitchen`) | ✅ | Columns New / In progress / Ready from the backend lifecycle; ticket age urgency; modifiers, notes, table, covers; Accept → Start → Ready → Served, Void; station filter (server-side); visibility-aware polling (5–30 s), stale-data banner |
| Back-office infrastructure | ✅ | `useQuery` / `usePaged` (cursor, bare-array, offset) / `useAction`; `DataTable`, `Pager`, filters, `FormDialog` (422 field errors), `ActionButton` (confirm / required note), `TransitionBar` (shared transition tables × permission), `apiDownload` for CSV |
| Route gating + nav | ✅ | Every page calls `gated(path)`; the owning nav entry's permission is the rule; unbuilt surfaces are `planned` and never linked (static test walks all page files) |
| Procurement | ✅ | Indents, POs, GRNs (post to ledger), bills, vendor payments + dues |
| Inventory | ✅ | Stock on hand (low / negative from server), per-material movement, ledger (material / type / source / date filters, source links), transfers (dispatch at source, receive at target), issues, stock counts (freeze → count sheet → review → approve), wastage, production (plan → start → complete with actual inputs) |
| CRM / loyalty | ✅ | Directory (server search), profile (stats, orders, loyalty ledger; adjust / redeem / expire with `loyalty.manage`), segments, feedback |
| Reservations | ✅ | Bookings by day with status-table actions (confirm, seat, assign table, complete, no-show, cancel), waitlist (arrived, seat → table, left, remove) |
| Staff | ✅ | Team + access (grantable roles only), activate/deactivate, attendance (self check-in/out, manager corrections), leave (request, approve/reject — never own), tasks |
| Finance | ✅ | Overview (daily closing blockers, P&L), payments & refunds (idempotent refunds), expenses, petty cash, cash drawer (server variance), reconciliation (daily payments count, POS / gateway / vendor runs, complete/lock) |
| Reports / exports | ✅ | Report center (server list, business-date filters, offset paging), inline CSV download, background export jobs + download |
| Anomalies / notifications | ✅ | Filters, run detection, acknowledge / resolve / dismiss (note required); notifications read / read-all |
| Admin | ✅ | Audit log (before/after inspector), organization, outlets (structural fields org-wide only), departments |
| Menu (`/menu`, `/menu/items/[id]`, `/menu/categories`, `/menu/modifiers`) | ✅ | Items with effective price / availability at the selected outlet (server fields), category (server) + search / status filters, local paging over the bounded org menu; create / edit / off-menu / sold-out everywhere (org-wide `menu.manage`); outlet price override (set / clear → null), offered, sold-out here (`menu.manage` at the outlet); variants (add, price change, activate); attach / detach modifier groups; plate cost + food-cost % from the approved recipe (`recipe.view`). Categories: create, rename, sort order, activate. Modifier groups: create, rename, min/max (checked before sending, enforced by the server), retire; options: add, extra price, activate |
| Recipes (`/recipes`, `/recipes/[id]`) | ✅ | Server search + output-type filter, cursor paging, latest version + status, approved-version count; create (menu item or sub-recipe → v1 DRAFT); version history; DRAFT edit (yield, unit, serving size, effective from, notes), add line (material in any convertible unit, or sub-recipe), remove line; approve / discard / archive per `RECIPE_VERSION_TRANSITIONS` × org-wide `recipe.approve`; new version copying a chosen version (only when no draft exists); cost at the selected outlet for yield or any quantity, per material, unpriced materials flagged; server refusals (cycles, missing conversions, unapproved sub-recipes) shown |
| Master data (`/master/materials[/id]`, `/master/vendors[/id]`, `/master/units`) | ✅ | Materials: server search / category / active filters, paging, create / edit (changed fields only), base unit **locked once stock has moved** (`stockMoved` from the API; the service still enforces it), activate, categories (list / create), vendor links, material-specific conversions, link to stock. Vendors: search / active, create / edit, bank details as returned (masked by the server without `vendor.manage`), supplied materials + link / edit terms / preferred, activate. Units: create / edit / activate (in-use rule from the server), conversions list + create (same unit, non-positive factor and cross-kind-without-material stopped before the call) |
| Floors & tables (`/tables`) | ✅ | Tables with floor, seats, status, QR issued; running orders (`order.view`) and today's bookings (`reservation.manage`) per table from the existing APIs; floor / status filters; status change (`outlet.manage` or `order.modify`; "active order" refusal shown); floors + tables create / edit and QR issue / rotate with confirmation (`outlet.manage`) |

Frontend limitations: KDS uses polling (no push transport); adding a round to an existing order is item-by-item (not one idempotent request); line notes use a native prompt; no offline mode / receipt printing yet.

Catalog limitations (this pass): the menu endpoint returns the whole org menu (≤ 1000 items) in one response, so item search / status filtering and paging are client-side and the item detail reads that list (no single-item endpoint); variant and modifier-option **names** cannot be changed and nothing in the menu can be deleted (deactivate instead) — the services only support price / active updates; recipes cannot be renamed or deactivated (no service); optional material / vendor / menu-item fields (category, email, POS code…) can be changed but not cleared (the service schemas are optional, not nullable); material categories and unit conversions have no edit / delete service; the plate-cost card uses the menu price, not the outlet override price (as `menuItemCostAndMargin` does); a table's QR token is shown as text (no QR image rendering or guest QR-ordering page).

Back-office limitations: list date filters on DateTime columns use the browser's day bounds (reports / finance / closing use outlet business days server-side); segment and feedback summaries are per loaded page; the aggregator reconciliation run needs an aggregator admin API (not built).

## Production verification & hardening (2026-10-01)

### Phase 5B — security & architecture hardening
Application-layer fixes for the remaining audit gaps. No database change (SQLite
in dev; no PostgreSQL RLS, no PostgreSQL cutover, no schema migration added).

| Gap | Fix | Tests |
|-----|-----|-------|
| **Organization isolation on writes.** `assertOutletAccess` is a no-op for org-wide / super-admin callers, so a write taking a client `outletId` could target another org's outlet. | New shared `assertOutletInOrg(db, ctx, outletId)` guard (exists + belongs-to-org) applied at the write entry points that lacked it: orders (`createOrderTx`), inventory ledger (`appendLedger`, the single writer — covers receipts/issues/transfers/wastage/production/counts), procurement (indent/PO/GRN), finance (expense/petty cash/drawer open), CRM feedback, reservations. Modules already doing the check (menu, staff, master-data floors/tables, business-day-backed finance) were left unchanged. | `tests/domain/org-isolation.test.ts` |
| **Notification provider could silently use the mock in production.** | `getNotificationProvider` now calls `assertMockAllowed` / `unknownProvider` like the payment factory: in production the mock is refused unless `ALLOW_MOCK_PROVIDERS=true`, and unknown names fail loudly. In-app notifications never use a provider. | `tests/integrations/notification-safety.test.ts` |
| **Export download/status checked ownership + `export.run` but not the report's own permission.** | `loadJob` now re-checks `REPORTS[kind].permission` at the job's outlet, so access revoked after creation blocks the download. Create and run were already correct (`runReport` re-authorizes). | `tests/domain/export-security.test.ts` |
| **No production config validation.** | `src/server/config/env.ts` + `src/instrumentation.ts`: at server start (production only) require `DATABASE_URL`, a non-placeholder `AUTH_SECRET` (≥32 chars), rate limiting enabled, valid `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`. No-op in dev/test; never prints secret values. Playwright's `next start` gets a real `AUTH_SECRET` so e2e still boots. | `tests/config/env-validation.test.ts` |

Verification this phase: focused suites green, full `vitest` **495/495** (41 files),
`tsc --noEmit` clean, `next lint` clean, `next build` ✅, Playwright **55/55**.
Password/auth lifecycle (Phase 5A) re-run with no regressions.

### Browser E2E (Playwright, production build, real API + DB) — 49 tests (earlier pass; now 55 incl. Phase 5A password specs)
The existing 31 (login, dashboard, POS, modifiers, payment, customers) all passed on first execution. Added 18 workflow tests:
| Spec | Workflows |
|------|-----------|
| `session.spec.ts` | sign-out revokes server-side (replayed cookie → 401); expired session rejected by pages + API with the right return path; no account enumeration; crafted post-login destination stays on-site |
| `order-lifecycle.spec.ts` | create → second round → discount → KOTs → KDS Accept/Start/Ready/Served → cash payment → recipe consumption on the ledger (exact quantities); manager cancellation with reason (cashier not offered it) |
| `backoffice-ops.spec.ts` | PO submit/approve/ordered → GRN → post → stock + ledger; wastage draft/post; expense → list + P&L delta; Expenses report + CSV download content |
| `catalog.spec.ts` | menu item created → appears in the cashier's POS; outlet price override at one outlet only; sold-out here enforced by the server (422) and in the POS; recipe draft → lines → server cost → approve → plate cost |
| `guests.spec.ts` | loyalty earned only when paid, visible on the customer profile; reservation book → confirm → seat at a table → complete |
| `rbac.spec.ts` | cashier blocked from purchasing / inventory / recipes / admin pages **and** APIs, menu read-only; kitchen: KDS yes, orders no; outlet vs org-wide menu authority; outlet isolation (Jubilee manager vs Central, outlet cookie re-validated); deactivation kills the live session, blocks sign-in, is audited |

### Bugs found and fixed
| Severity | Bug | Fix |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Critical | Next.js 15.1.4: RCE (React flight), middleware auth bypass, Windows / image-optimizer RCE, SSRF, cache poisoning (npm audit) | next 15.5.27, react 19.0.8 (lockfile) |
| High | Open redirect after sign-in: `next=/\evil.example` passed `safeNext` (browsers read `/\` as `//`) | origin-based `safeReturnPath` (resolve, then require the same origin) |
| High | Login rate-limit bypass: client IP taken from the **leftmost** (client-controlled) X-Forwarded-For; spoofed-IP floods could also evict per-account counters | IP read at the trusted proxy's position (`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS`, default 1) |
| High | Demo seed had no guard: against production it wipes all data and creates an owner with a public password | refuses under `NODE_ENV=production` or when non-demo users exist (`ALLOW_DEMO_SEED=true` overrides) |
| Medium | Mock payment / POS providers usable in production via the factories (fake gateway verification and refund ids); unknown provider names fell back to the mock | factories enforce `ALLOW_MOCK_PROVIDERS`; unknown names fail |
| Medium | PostgreSQL: raw-SQL date filters shifted by the server TimeZone (daily sales / day-part on non-UTC servers) | bounds bound as `::timestamptz AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`; CI PostgreSQL now non-UTC |
| Medium | PostgreSQL: case-sensitive search ("paneer" ≠ "Paneer") | `textContains()` (`mode: "insensitive"` on PostgreSQL) |
| Medium | Signed-in user opening `/login` → server error (a server component called a client-module function) | server-safe helper |
| Low | Expired / revoked session on a back-office page lost the return path (always `/dashboard`) | middleware forwards the path (always overwritten); the layout validates it |
| Low | Stale `prisma/postgres/schema.prisma` + `baseline.sql` (missing the Payment idempotency index) | regenerated |
| Low | No health endpoint (middleware whitelisted a missing `/api/health`) | `GET /api/health` (DB ping, no details) |

### Open findings (not fixed — see docs/production-readiness.md)
- ~~Blocker — no account provisioning~~ — resolved in Phase 5A: `npm run bootstrap:owner` (first owner on an empty database), one-time setup/reset links (hashed, single-use, expiring; `PasswordToken` table), `/set-password`, `/forgot-password` (no account enumeration), `/account/password` (revokes other sessions). Remaining: no email/SMS delivery for self-service reset links (managers hand links over).
- Services validate input before authorizing (unauthorized + malformed body → 422 with schema details instead of 403; no data exposure).
- ~~Export download does not re-check the report's own permission.~~ — resolved in Phase 5B (download/status re-check the report permission + org/outlet, not just ownership).
- Unit conversions are looked up in one direction only (the seed has kg→g, so gram recipe lines for kg materials are rejected, with raw ids in the message).
- One login took 16.6 s under heavy host memory pressure (8 GB RAM, ~1.3 GB free); not reproducible in isolation (120–260 ms) or in later runs.

## Next phase
Resolve the remaining MUST items in `docs/production-readiness.md` (account provisioning is done), then a controlled single-instance PostgreSQL deployment. RLS before a second, untrusted organization shares the database.
