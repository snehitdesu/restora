# RESTORA (Aharos) — Testing

## Current totals (2026-10-09, end of the master program)
| Suite | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Unit + DB integration, SQLite | `npm test` | 160 files, 1605 passed, 8 skipped, 0 failed |
| Same suite, PostgreSQL 16 | `TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://…/<fresh db> npm run test:pg` | 160 files (157 run, 3 skipped), 1582 passed, 31 skipped, 0 failed |
| Browser E2E (production build), SQLite | `npm run e2e` | 133/133 (5 sign-in setups + 128 specs), CI |
| Browser E2E, PostgreSQL 16 | `E2E_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://…/<fresh, empty db> npm run e2e:test` | 133/133, CI (PostgreSQL 16 service container, committed migrations, demo seed) |
| Investor business flow (Razorpay emulator) | `npm run e2e:investor` | 3/3, CI |
| Desktop E2E + packaged-app verification | `npm run desktop:build && npm run desktop:e2e`; `npx electron-builder --dir && npm run desktop:verify` | Windows, macOS arm64 and macOS x64 in CI: build, E2E, packaging (fuses, asar integrity, upgrade from the previous release, launch attacks), DMG |
| Backup / restore drill, load test | `node scripts/ops/backup-drill.mjs`, `node scripts/ops/load-test.mjs` | 2026-10-09 on the current schema: drill 10/10; load run 0 correctness violations (`docs/production-infrastructure.md` §7.1, §8.0). PITR drill and post-deploy smoke last run 2026-10-05 |

**All of the above except the drills run in CI on every change** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: SQLite, PostgreSQL 16, web E2E on both,
investor flow, desktop on Windows and both macOS architectures). The 160 Vitest files: `tests/domain` 74, `tests/ui` 32, `tests/api` 22,
`tests/db` 9, `tests/integrations` 6, `tests/auth` 5, `tests/desktop` 4, `tests/config` 3, and one each in `tests/docs` (audit totals),
`tests/e2e` (guest journey in the service layer), `tests/ops`, `tests/qa`, `tests/site`. Browser specs: `e2e/*.spec.ts` (33 files) plus
`e2e/investor/`; desktop: `desktop/e2e/`.

Where to find the tests of a group: `docs/group-delivery-map.md`. Quality gates that are tests, not documents: `e2e/quality-sweep.spec.ts`
(ten viewports from 320 to 1920 px plus a phone held sideways: no console error, no error status, no sideways scrolling; axe WCAG 2.1 A / AA
at a phone and a desktop width, serious or critical findings fail), `tests/db/append-only.test.ts` (the database refuses to change history),
`tests/docs/audit-totals.test.ts` (the audit's totals match its rows).

Notes for running locally:
- The SQLite and PostgreSQL suites share one generated Prisma client: run `npx prisma generate` (SQLite) or
  `npx prisma generate --schema prisma/postgres/schema.prisma` before switching, and never run both at once. `npm run build`
  regenerates the SQLite client; build with `npx next build` after generating the PostgreSQL client.
- Playwright pins a Chromium build; if the image has another one, point a throwaway config at it with
  `use.launchOptions.executablePath` instead of changing the repository config.
- `tests/desktop/shell-policy.test.ts` has a Windows-path test (runs on Windows only) and a POSIX twin: `sqliteUrl`
  resolves with the host's path rules by design.
- E2E and the demo seed use the outlet's business day (Asia/Kolkata), not the host's calendar day; the Money Desk spec
  depends on yesterday being untouched. The demo outlets are open 11:00-23:30; `e2e/prepare-db.ts` (and the load script) open them all day so
  guest ordering does not depend on the time the suite runs, and the storefront spec sets its own hours to test the closed state.
- With `RATE_LIMIT_STORE=database` the counters live in `RateLimitWindow` and survive a server restart: clear that table between load runs
  on a disposable database.
- Tests that fill a form before the page has hydrated hold back the scripts on purpose (`LOGIN-002b`, `PWD-007`); other specs wait for hydration.

PostgreSQL databases for tests must be **fresh** (create one per run): nothing in
the test harnesses resets or force-pushes a database. The section below is the
historical description (SQLite mechanics are unchanged).

## Commands
```bash
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit (0 errors)
npm test            # vitest run (unit + DB integration)
npm run build       # prisma generate && next build
npm run db:seed     # rebuild demo data in dev.db
```

## Test database
Tests run against a dedicated `prisma/test.db`, recreated from the schema by
`vitest.global-setup.ts` before each run (never touches `dev.db`). The `@/`
alias is resolved via `vitest.config.ts`.

**Files run sequentially** (`fileParallelism: false`): every suite is a DB
integration test on one SQLite file, and SQLite allows a single writer.
Parallel files contended for the write lock and Prisma's interactive
transactions (5s timeout) aborted nondeterministically. Tests inside a file
already run in order. Each suite creates its own organization, so suites are
data-isolated.

## Coverage (448 tests in 35 files, all passing on SQLite and on PostgreSQL 16)
| File | Focus |

| `tests/api/routes.test.ts` | route handlers over HTTP: auth, errors, RBAC/scope, order flow, exports |
| `tests/api/security.test.ts` | rate limiting (store, policies, router), login lockout, uniform 401, Origin checks, body limits, client IP from the trusted proxy position (not the client-controlled X-Forwarded-For), mock providers refused in production / unknown providers rejected, health endpoint |
| `tests/domain/timezone.test.ts` | business-day utility (UTC/IST/Tokyo/New York DST) + multi-outlet finance/analytics/reports |
| `tests/domain/idempotency-refunds.test.ts` | order Idempotency-Key (retry, concurrency, conflicts) + gateway refund webhooks |
| `tests/domain/reservation-concurrency.test.ts` | slot locks: 5 concurrent bookings → exactly 1 |
| `tests/domain/outlet-menu.test.ts` | per-outlet price / offered / sold-out |
| `tests/domain/master-data.test.ts` | units, materials, vendors, outlets, tables + procurement/stock document reads |
| `tests/domain/export-jobs.test.ts`, `export-security.test.ts` | background exports through the default runner: lifecycle, re-authorization, single execution, storage safety, download re-check |
| `tests/domain/export-lifecycle.test.ts` | transitions, revoked/deactivated/tampered at run time, two-worker race, ORDERS CSV end to end, IDOR / cross-org / traversal / non-SUCCESS / expired downloads, no storage keys in API, audit trail, retention, restart recovery |
| `tests/config/security-headers.test.ts` | production vs development headers + CSP, served by next.config |
| `tests/e2e/guest-journey.test.ts` | customer → reservation → table → order → kitchen → payment → loyalty, with failure paths |
| `tests/domain/admin-queries.test.ts` | back-office reads/admin commands: org, departments, floors, conversions, modifier groups, role matrix, lists — auth, isolation, paging |
| `tests/domain/backoffice-support.test.ts` | backend additions for the menu / recipe / master-data screens: `updateModifierGroup` (+ `PATCH /api/menu/modifier-groups/:id`), recipe reads with resolved names (KITCHEN reads without master.view), recipe search + version summary, named cost lines, `getMaterial.stockMoved`, `RECIPE_VERSION_TRANSITIONS` ↔ service, case-insensitive search (materials / vendors / customers / recipes — PostgreSQL `LIKE` is case-sensitive) |
| `tests/domain/payment-balance.test.ts` | successful payments never exceed the order total: re-check at verification, concurrent creations/verifications, splits, partials, idempotent re-verify, failed/abandoned payments, over-balance gateway capture, cancelled orders, refunds |
| `tests/auth/session-security.test.ts` | H3 server side: every sensitive endpoint (refund, order void, bill cancel, staff/role changes, password link, organization/outlet settings, desktop restore authorization) refuses without a fresh scoped grant and passes with one; route tables cannot hold an unprotected duplicate/shadow; expiry, wrong password, rate limit, tenant isolation, no privilege gain; idle timeout and logout |
| `tests/auth/reauth-client.test.ts` | H3 UI ↔ API: the real browser client (`api()` re-auth retry) against the real route handlers and DB — cancel / wrong password change nothing, the right password performs the operation exactly once, expired grant and ended session fail safely without loops, cashier gains nothing |
| `tests/ui/reauth-dialog.test.tsx` | H3 dialog (ReauthProvider): opens on ReauthRequiredError with the reason, password only in a POST body (never URL/logs/storage) and cleared, cancel/Esc/close, wrong password, single retry with the same request, expired grant, ended session, rate limit, shared dialog for concurrent requests, stacking over a confirm dialog, desktop bridge |
| `tests/domain/pos-backend.test.ts` | atomic idempotent `placeOrder`, counter payments without a gateway, KDS ticket enrichment |
| `tests/ui/logic.test.ts` | cart reducer, modifier rules, **estimate ↔ server totals parity**, submit guard, payment math, KDS lifecycle, permission-aware nav |
| `tests/ui/infra.test.ts` | API client error mapping, poller (no overlap / stale drop / visibility), middleware redirects, requested-path forwarding (spoofed header overwritten), same-origin post-login return paths, open health probe |
| `tests/ui/components.test.tsx` (jsdom) | POS cart + single idempotent submit + retry with same key, modifier dialog, payment validation / single payment / retry-confirm, KDS tickets + transitions + station filter, login |
| `tests/ui/backoffice.test.tsx` (jsdom) | procurement + inventory screens: API-only data, server filters/paging, status × permission actions, one call per action |
| `tests/ui/backoffice-modules.test.tsx` (jsdom) | CRM, reservations, staff, finance, reports/exports, anomalies/notifications, admin |
| `tests/ui/backoffice-catalog.test.tsx` (jsdom, 40) | menu items (outlet effective price/availability, outlet overrides vs org-wide edits, variants, modifier attach/detach, plate cost), categories, modifier groups/options (min ≤ max checked before sending), recipes (list search/paging, create, draft edit / add / remove line, approve / archive per `RECIPE_VERSION_TRANSITIONS` × `recipe.approve`, cost + server errors), materials (filters, create, base-unit lock, changed-fields-only edits, categories), vendors (server-masked bank details, edits, links, deactivate), units (invalid conversions stopped client-side, in-use rule surfaced), floors & tables (running orders / bookings per table, status by order.modify, setup + QR rotation by outlet.manage, outlet scoping), loading / empty / error states, nav visibility |
| `tests/ui/route-gating.test.ts` | every page under `src/app/(app)` calls `gated(<own path>)` and is owned by a built nav entry; every visible nav entry has a page |

UI tests opt into jsdom per file (`// @vitest-environment jsdom`) and use
@testing-library (dev dependencies only); the network is a mocked `fetch`.

### PostgreSQL
`TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://… npm run test:pg` runs the same suite on
PostgreSQL: generated schema + client, then the committed history is applied with
`prisma migrate deploy` (nothing is reset; use a FRESH disposable database per run).
**Executed 2026-10-04 on PostgreSQL 16.14 (non-UTC TimeZone), fresh database:
640 passed, 21 skipped (SQLite-only desktop/bootstrap suites), 0 failed.** Run
`npx prisma generate` afterwards to restore the SQLite client, and never run SQLite
and PostgreSQL suites concurrently in one checkout (they share the generated client).
`tests/db/decimal-precision.test.ts` covers the DECIMAL classes, rounding, overflow → 422
and migration drift (docs/postgres.md).

## Browser E2E (Playwright)
`npm run e2e` builds, then `npm run e2e:test` starts `next start` (production mode) on
port 3210 against an isolated database rebuilt and seeded on every run
(`e2e/prepare-db.ts`: SQLite `prisma/e2e.db`, or a disposable PostgreSQL database via
`E2E_DATABASE_URL`). Each role signs in once through the real /login page
(`e2e/auth.setup.ts`); specs verify what the UI did through the real authenticated API.
No API mocking. Requires `npx playwright install chromium` once.

**49 tests, all passing on SQLite and on PostgreSQL 16 (2026-10-01):**
| Spec | Covers |
|------|--------|
| `login.spec.ts`, `session.spec.ts` | sign-in, wrong password, redirects with return path, sign-out revocation (replayed cookie rejected), session expiry, no enumeration, open-redirect guard |
| `dashboard.spec.ts` | real outlet data, outlet switching |
| `pos.spec.ts`, `modifiers.spec.ts`, `payment.spec.ts` | dine-in → KDS, rapid taps / lost responses (one order, one KOT, one consumption), order types, customers, modifier rules priced by the server, cash / change / partial / retries without double payment |
| `order-lifecycle.spec.ts` | second round, discount, KDS Accept → Start → Ready → Served, payment, exact ledger consumption; manager-only cancellation |
| `backoffice-ops.spec.ts` | PO → GRN → post → stock; wastage; expense → P&L; report + CSV |
| `catalog.spec.ts` | menu item → POS; outlet price override; sold-out enforced server-side; recipe draft → cost → approve → plate cost |
| `guests.spec.ts` | loyalty on paid orders; reservation book → confirm → seat → complete |
| `rbac.spec.ts` | page + API refusals per role, outlet isolation, org-wide vs outlet authority, deactivation (session killed, sign-in refused, audited) |
| `qr-transaction.spec.ts` (Phase 2) | three parties at once — guest phone (no account) scans the table QR → menu → modifiers → order; POS sees the incoming QR order and accepts it (KOT); KDS Accept → Start → Ready → Served while the guest page follows; guest pays (test gateway: decline then approve); guest receipt == POS reprint; exact stock consumption and sales delta. Prepaid order reaches the KDS without staff; invalid QR; price tampering (422); cross-origin (403); a lost response + refresh replays the same order |

The E2E database is only ever modified through the app, except `e2eDb()` in
`e2e/helpers.ts`, used solely to simulate the passage of time (expiring one session).

Test data is created through the real services. Exceptions: master data with
no admin service yet (units, materials, vendors, tables) is inserted directly,
and one export test injects a simulated DB fault to exercise the FAILED path.

## Core transaction (Phase 2)
| Command | Covers |
|---------|--------|
| `npx vitest run tests/domain/qr-transaction.test.ts` | QR token resolution (malformed / unknown / rotated / inactive outlet), guest menu (outlet prices, sold-out, no admin fields), server pricing + strict schema (price/total tampering, qty 0 / 1.5 / 51), invalid modifiers & variants, cross-tenant dishes / tables / staff, order access keys, waiting-order cap, the full chain QR → accept → KOT per station → KDS (repeat taps no-op, illegal jumps refused) → decline / retry / pay → PAID → consumption once → receipt == staff bill → sales/daily/item/payment analytics, prepaid → KOT, concurrent guest payments (exactly one SUCCESS), checkout refresh resumes the pending payment, split counter + online, cancellation (KOTs cancelled, no consumption, terminal), cancel refused while money is held, repricing frozen after PAID / never below paid, qty on a sent item refused, added items on an additional KOT only, bill tax breakdown / rounding |
| `npx vitest run tests/api/guest-routes.test.ts` | `/api/qr/*` without a session: no-store, uniform 404 for bad tokens, Idempotency-Key required, cross-origin 403, body cap 413, tampering 422, `x-order-key` access, pay + confirm (a client "status" is refused), staff bill route auth + tenant scope, per-table rate limit 429 |
| `npx vitest run tests/ui/guest.test.tsx` | guest menu/cart/modifiers → one POST with items only (no prices) and a replay-safe key, server refusal shown + menu refresh, order page key from the URL fragment (header, never the URL), test gateway decline → approve, bill rendering (never "tax invoice"), browser-state helpers |

## Inventory & procurement (Phase 3)
| Command | Covers |
|---------|--------|
| `npx vitest run tests/domain/inventory-procurement.test.ts` | base-unit posting (2 crates -> 24 kg at a per-kg rate; average cost across units; incompatible units refused everywhere), GRN vs PO (receivable status, vendor, material, open quantity, rejected goods, batches, concurrent posting), derived PO states, PO from indent, bill three-way match / no double billing / vendor-invoice duplicates / concurrent bills, creation idempotency, shortages (incl. concurrent issues), transfer receipt rules + carried cost, opening stock, adjustments (reason, key, approval threshold, audit, report), variant factor + stock-consuming modifiers exactly once, cancel / refund, unmapped queue, tenant / outlet isolation |
| `npx vitest run tests/api/inventory-routes.test.ts` | the new routes over HTTP: 401 / 403 / 404 / 409 / 422, origin check, Idempotency-Key headers |
| `npx vitest run tests/ui/inventory-ops.test.tsx` | stock-screen opening-stock / adjustment dialogs, unmapped queue |
| `e2e/inventory-procurement.spec.ts` | opening stock + reasoned adjustment from the Stock screen; GRN key replay; bill from a GRN with the vendor invoice number, duplicate invoice 409, double billing 422 |

The SQLite test database (`vitest.global-setup.ts`) and the E2E database (`e2e/prepare-db.ts`) are built with `prisma migrate deploy` from the committed history (previously `db push`).

## Finance (Phase 4)
| Command | Covers |
|---------|--------|
| `npx vitest run tests/domain/finance-p4.test.ts` | GSTIN checksum, financial year, CGST/SGST split, invoice numbering (gapless, unique, concurrent, credit notes never colliding), tax after discount, sub-paisa refusal, B2B buyer GSTIN, credit notes on refunds, expenses (categories, idempotency, void), petty cash, drawer pay-in/out + frozen variance, cash + gateway reconciliation, vendor partial / duplicate / concurrent payments, reversal, aging, statement, finance reports, RBAC, tenant isolation |
| `npx vitest run tests/api/finance-routes.test.ts` | finance + invoice routes over HTTP: Idempotency-Key headers, 2-decimal rule, re-auth gate for void / reversal, 401/403/404/409/422 |
| `npx vitest run tests/ui/finance-p4.test.tsx` | expense categories + keyed retry, void with reason, drawer cash in/out |
| `e2e/finance.spec.ts` | expense -> void (password re-confirmation) -> out of list and P&L; paid POS order -> invoice number, GSTIN, CGST/SGST after discount on the bill, tax summary |
| `npx vitest run tests/domain/analytics-p5.test.ts` | Phase 5: fully refunded order nets to 0 (no double count), refunds ex tax from credit notes, payment methods (split / partial / full refunds), discount-aware item / category / variant / modifier revenue reconciling with net sales, IST business-day filters + buckets, week / month trends, outlet comparison + isolation, consumption / wastage / movement / slow-dead-negative stock, finance overview (voided expenses, reversed vendor payments, net output tax, P&L estimate), deterministic insights + permissions |
| `npx vitest run tests/api/analytics-routes.test.ts` | analytics over HTTP: business-day date-only filters, 422 validation, RBAC per metric, tenant scope, insights |
| `npx vitest run tests/ui/analytics.test.tsx` | Analytics screen: tabs by permission, filters, weekly trend, insight explanations, P&L labelled an estimate |
| `e2e/analytics.spec.ts` | discounted POS order + full refund move today's analytics exactly once; the Analytics screen end to end |
| `npx vitest run tests/domain/staff-mobile.test.ts` | Phase 6: keyed atomic order rounds (menu prices only, replay, 409, concurrent), unsent-line removal, request bill (rules, table, cashier alert) then payment, kot.serve, table board, manager sections per role, ACCOUNTANT, rank ceilings / self-edit / inactive users, role-filtered notifications with per-user reads, NEW_ORDER / PAYMENT_FAILED |
| `npx vitest run tests/api/mobile-routes.test.ts` | Phase 6 over HTTP: rounds with Idempotency-Key, removal, bill, mobile read models (403 / 404 / 422), per-user notification reads, staff admin behind reauth, privilege escalation, deactivation ends the session |
| `npx vitest run tests/ui/mobile.test.tsx` | captain and manager phone screens: board, keyed send reused on retry, round, serve, bill, offline banner, alerts, staff cards |
| `e2e/staff-mobile.spec.ts` | phone viewport: captain end to end with kitchen + cashier, manager incl. staff admin, server-side refusals |
| `npx vitest run tests/integrations/razorpay.test.ts` | Phase 7: Razorpay adapter contract (no network): checkout amount, checkout signature + capture checks, order-status verification, bounded retries / 4xx / malformed / timeout, webhook signature + parsing, refunds, settlements, credential redaction |
| `npx vitest run tests/integrations/phase7-units.test.ts` | ESC/POS rendering, printer SSRF guard, phone normalization / masking, Twilio status mapping, accounting CSV / Tally formats, bounded backoff |
| `npx vitest run tests/domain/integrations-p7.test.ts` | gateway checkout / webhooks / refunds end to end, printing + drawer over a real TCP endpoint, messaging outbox (MOCK + Twilio contract), aggregator cancellation + status push, accounting export, integration management security |
| `npx vitest run tests/api/integrations-routes.test.ts` | Phase 7 routes over HTTP: RBAC, re-confirmation, write-only secrets, SSRF 422, cross-tenant 404, messaging webhook signature |
| `npx vitest run tests/ui/integrations.test.tsx` | Integrations / printers screens, receipt send + reprint reason |
| `e2e/integrations.spec.ts` | simulated printer + drawer kick + receipt reprint; MOCK messaging + accounting export + forged webhook; manager refused |

## Desktop app (Phase 7)

| Command | What it runs |
|---|---|
| `npx vitest run tests/desktop` | migrator (schema identical to `prisma migrate deploy`, history accepted by `prisma migrate status`, refusals: unmanaged DB / newer-version migration / changed checksum / failed migration rolled back), upgrade from the previous release with real rows (data intact, verified pre-migration backup, failed upgrade recoverable) and restore (older backup upgraded; un-migratable backup → previous data put back; corrupt file refused), SQL splitter, verified backups + rotation, shell policy (navigation, IPC validation, child env, debugger switches), `config.json` |
| `npm run desktop:pack && npm run desktop:verify` | the PACKAGED, fused `Aharos.exe`: fuse wire, start-up upgrade of a previous-release database + Owner sign-in over the real API + automatic backup, `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` / `NODE_OPTIONS` / `--inspect` / `--remote-debugging-port` refused, tampered `app.asar` refused (docs/desktop-release.md) |
| `npm run desktop:build && npm run desktop:e2e` | Playwright drives the real Electron app (unpacked build) on a fresh data directory |
| `npm run desktop:build && npx tsx desktop/scripts/ui-tour.ts [outDir]` | visual tour: setup wizard, sign-in and every navigable screen at 1024×700 / 1280×720 / 1366×768 / 1920×1080 (screenshots in `e2e/.results-desktop/ui-tour`); fails loudly on horizontal overflow, HTTP errors, error boundaries or an "Aharos" window title |
| `AHAROS_DESKTOP_EXE=dist-desktop/win-unpacked/Aharos.exe npm run desktop:e2e` | the same suite against the packaged (or an installed) `Aharos.exe` |

`desktop/e2e/desktop.spec.ts` (5 tests): first-run wizard (IPC junk rejected,
password policy enforced, local DB initialized, secret DPAPI-protected) → login →
POS order → KOT → KDS Accept/Start/Ready/Served → cash payment → back-office pages;
renderer isolation (no Node globals, external requests and navigation blocked,
`localhost` pinned to 127.0.0.1, validated IPC, mock printer reports `simulated`);
RBAC through the shell (cashier refused audit/inventory/staff/menu writes, logout
revokes); restart (session + data persist, automatic verified backup, startup timings).
Set `AHAROS_KEEP_E2E_DATA=1` to keep the temporary data directory for inspection.
