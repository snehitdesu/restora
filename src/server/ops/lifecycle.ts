/**
 * Process lifecycle: readiness phase, in-flight API request tracking and
 * graceful shutdown.
 *
 *   starting -> ready (instrumentation finished startup work)
 *            -> draining (SIGTERM / SIGINT): readiness answers 503 so the load
 *               balancer stops routing here; after SHUTDOWN_DELAY_MS new API
 *               requests are refused with 503 + Retry-After; in-flight API
 *               requests are awaited (bounded by SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_MS); the
 *               process then keeps refusing for SHUTDOWN_REFUSE_GRACE_MS so
 *               connections the kernel accepted but Node had not read yet get
 *               their 503 instead of a connection reset when the server closes
 *            -> shutdown tasks (stop background workers, settle post-commit
 *               side effects, let the export runner finish, disconnect the
 *               database) -> stopped -> Next.js closes the HTTP server and exits.
 *
 * Nothing durable depends on the drain completing: every side effect is a row
 * (PrintJob / IntegrationDelivery / ExportJob / WebhookEvent) that the
 * maintenance worker or the provider's retry recovers after a hard kill. The
 * drain only makes a normal deploy/restart lose nothing in flight.
